Hello World!

With this nice greeting I can start to share my story and purpose to the cyber world!.. 

dah, just kidding.

My name is Ã¶zgÃ¼r and mostly foreign friends call me as ozy or ozzzgurr because "Ã¶zgÃ¼r" is very hard to pronounce for non-turkish speakers that I accept what they call me ðŸ¤”.


I am an electronics and communication engineer with approximately 2 years experience on LTE System Integration and Testing I have also one year experince about microwave boards and antenna systems designig. My main bases are electromagnetic fields, microwave and antenna engineering.
                    
I love automate every piece of work. It is not for laziness in fact. The main reason for automation is saving more time to development and improving the quality of work.  


I am creating fullstack web and android apps individually. After upgrating to my personal computer that it is not enough dude to handle flutter, my purpose is learn Flutter and dart. No time for react, the future i see is Flutter on cross development !!!

Very soon, I will move to Krakow/Poland. I am going to be an Rf test engineer at Nokia Solutions. It will be new chapter for my career and I am very excited for it.


the code bellow just for test the page ðŸ˜Š
```javascript
const Razorpay = require('razorpay');

let rzp = Razorpay({
	key_id: 'KEY_ID',
	secret: 'name'
});

// capture request
rzp.capture(payment_id, cost)
	.then(function (data) {
		return 2;
	})
```

yes! I can prompt the code as I want!


I will share in this blog my "error and bug diary" which will help to mostly fresh coders and microwave program contributors.


The fist post shouldn't be long!

Sincerely,
Ozgur
